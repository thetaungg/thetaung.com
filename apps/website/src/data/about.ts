    paragraph: `<p>I've enjoyed build things and learning new things since I was a kid. I started reading programming books as soon as I knew how to use a computer. 
    Built WordPress sites, and blogged about how to use computers back then. 
    <br />
    Because of that passion, working with code feels more like a hobby than a job.</p>

    <p>Today, I balance working at Webbee GmbH as a Senior Frontend Engineer, building my own products on the side and learning cool stuffs.</p>`,
